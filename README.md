# SASjs

SASjs is a open-source framework for building Web Apps on SASÂ® platforms. You can use as much or as little of it as you like. This repository contains the JS adapter, that handles the to/from SAS communication on the client side. There are 3 ways to install it:

1 - `npm install sasjs` - for use in a node project

2 - [Download](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sasjs/index.js) and use a copy of the latest JS file

3 - Reference directly from the CDN - in which case click [here](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/sasjs?tab=collection) and select "SRI" to get the script tag with the integrity hash.

If you are short on time and just need to build an app quickly, then check out [this video](https://vimeo.com/393161794) and the [react-seed-app](https://github.com/macropeople/react-seed-app) which provides some boilerplate.
