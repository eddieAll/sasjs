# SASjs

SASjs is a open-source framework for building Web Apps on SASÂ® platforms. You can use as much or as little of it as you like.  This repository contains the JS adapter, that handles the to/from SAS communication on the client side.  To use this library, either `npm install sasjs` or stick it in a script tag like so:

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sasjs@1.6.0/index.js" integrity="sha384-ppDMKTgsjRnY/9ORpxSHFFFo/0yv70I/IYjyWClq1dXOxYkFWaw+lCWU6BSjMKMP" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

If you are short on time and just need to build an app quickly, then check out [this video](ttps://vimeo.com/393161794) and the [react-seed-app](https://github.com/macropeople/react-seed-app) which provides some boilerplate.
