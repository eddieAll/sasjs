Browsers
==============

Most likely you will only need to test you applications against a very limited set of browsers (the ones your company uses, which typically inludes IE).

For testing a wider set of browsers, the following tools are useful

* Browserstack (paid)
* https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/  (previous versions of FF)
