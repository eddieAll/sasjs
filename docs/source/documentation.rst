It's said that quality of software is measured by the quality of it's documentation!

Guides
######

As a minimum, the following guides should be produced for each app:

* User Guide
* Configuration Guide
* Deployment Guide
* Developer Guide

Building Documentation
######################

Whilst the concept of "word documents on sharepoint sites" is still etched into the skulls of many, there are alternatives available if your firewalls allow.  Whilst proprietary office formats and rich text editors are user friendly, they don't fit easily and transparently into source control and continuous integration workflows.

The primary Text Based markup options are MarkDown (md) and reStructuredText (rst).  Markdown is easier to learn, whilst RST format is more flexible (can generate PDFs and also provide documentation within code files).

README
******
Suitable for small projects, all four guides could be added to a single README file in the root of your repo.  Using a tool such as `markdown-to-html <https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-to-html>`_ you can even convert your README into a nicely formatted HTML page as part of your build process.

    ``markdown "$MYPROJECT/README.md" > "$BUILDLOC/deploy/README.html"``

MkDocs
********
Suitable for medium / large projects, this is a great tool for generating a static HTML site where each page can be written in MarkDown.

The Data Controller for SASÂ® `documentation <https://docs.datacontroller.io/>`_ (`source <https://github.com/macropeople/dcdocs.github.io>`_) is built in this way .


DoxyGen
*******

`DoxyGen <http://www.doxygen.nl/>`_ is a commandline tool that can generate a number of output formats, similar to Sphinx.  More suitable for documenting code, than generating standalone docs (although it can do that also).

The MacroPeople MacroCore library is documented this way:  `https://macropeople.github.io/macrocore.github.io/files.html <https://macropeople.github.io/macrocore.github.io/files.html>`_.

Sphinx
******

Primarily used for writing in `rst` format, `sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_ is a very powerful documentation builder, built in python and used for all the official python documentation.  The founder of this language went on to launch `readthedocs.org <readthedocs.org>`_, a hosting platform for Sphinx-built sites.

The documentation you are reading right now was built in Sphinx!
